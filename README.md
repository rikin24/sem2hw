# sem2hw
Rest API development for a university timetable with the use of Spring and various libraries.

The Spring Boot Application works through a local host connection to a mySQL database and allows for various rest controller commands to get, post, delete and
update (put/patch) different details within the Convenor, Module and Session tables. 

Each of these 3 are linked with database relationships and a postman collection file can be found within the repository that shows an example of Postman tests with
various scenarios and rest controller commands.
